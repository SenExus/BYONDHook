// pch.h: This is a precompiled header file.
// The files listed below are compiled only once, which improves performance for subsequent compilations.
// This setting also affects IntelliSense performance, including code completion and many other code exploration features.
// However, the files listed here are ALL recompiled if one of them is updated from build to build.
// Do not add files that are subject to frequent updates here; otherwise you will lose the benefits offered in terms of performance.
